# Full Stack React & Express Contacts Manager

This app is comprised of an Express server with authentication and CRUD capabilities & a React App. You can create and manage your contacts after registering and logging in to the app.

The React App uses the Context API and React Hooks.

The backend uses MongoDB & Mongoose, so either hook up your local MongoDB Server or just use Mongo Cloud Atlas.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install the client app:

> > npm run clientinstall

2. Install the server app:

> > npm install

3. Run both of the apps side by side:

> > npm run dev

### Bugs

I will document this app properly at some point - but any questions or bugs please hit me up on Github.

Cheers,
Ashley
